# Welcome to the official AITwo github page!
This is the first AITwo repository. Thanks for just coming to my github page!
# What is AITwo?
It is a simple ChatBot that is coded with QB64. It is made by one person. It is open source. The program mainly runs on Windows, but you can use linux programs like Wine ( https://wiki.winehq.org/Download ). AITwo is completely free to use. You are allowed to use it in your own project (code), but I would love it if you give me some credit.
# What is QB64?
QB64 is an awesome programming language. QB stands for Quick Basics. 64 doesn't stand for anything, not even 64 bits. Check out https://www.qb64.org/.
# Support / Discord
The only way of AITwo support is the official Discord server! Check it out: https://discord.gg/Wvhtwxf. Make sure you follow the Discord TOS and guidelines. You must be at least 13 to use it.
