# Welcome to the official my chatbot's github page!
Thanks for just coming to my github page!
# What is this?
It is a simple chat bot that is coded with QB64. It is made by one person. It is open source. The program mainly runs on Windows, but you can use linux programs like Wine ( https://wiki.winehq.org/Download ). This is completely free to use. You are allowed to use it in your own project (code), but I would love it if you give me some credit.
# What is QB64?
QB64 is an awesome programming language. QB stands for Quick Basics. 64 doesn't stand for anything, not even 64 bits. Check out https://www.qb64.org/.
